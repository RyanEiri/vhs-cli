# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

The bash-script half of a VHS digitization pipeline with archival intent. Bash scripts capture VHS tapes via hardware (V4L2/ALSA), process them through denoising and deinterlacing, and produce lossless masters and viewer derivatives. Editing is done in Kdenlive; the scripts handle everything before and after.

This repo (`vhs-cli`) is one of three sibling projects forked from a former monorepo:
- **`vhs-cli`** (this repo) — the bash pipeline scripts, for terminal/standalone use.
- **`vhs-gui`** — a native Rust desktop app that reimplements most of this same workflow natively (not by calling these scripts) as a GUI. Independent of this repo; no shared code or dependency in either direction.
- **`plex-reencoder`** — unrelated Plex library re-encode/cleanup tooling, split out separately.

All three expect to live as siblings under `~/Videos/` (`~/Videos/vhs-cli/`, `~/Videos/vhs-gui/`, `~/Videos/plex-reencoder/`), alongside the data directories (`captures/`, `backups/`, `logs/`) which belong to none of them — they're local working directories referenced by absolute/configurable path. Scripts use two separate root variables: `VIDEOS_DIR` (data, defaults to `~/Videos`) and `SCRIPTS_DIR` (this repo, defaults to `~/Videos/vhs-cli`), both overridable via environment.

Archival masters (FFV1/PCM) are retained when storage permits. When storage is constrained, only the viewer/access copy is kept after editing. Scripts and codec policy are written to always produce a lossless master — whether it is retained afterward is a storage decision, not a pipeline one.

## Codec Policy (Strict — Do Not Violate)

- **Archival/intermediates:** FFV1 video + PCM (pcm_s16le) audio in MKV. No exceptions.
- **Viewer/Plex derivatives:** H.264 video + AAC audio in MKV. These are disposable.
- No ProRes. No HandBrake in the master pipeline.

## Architecture

### Pipeline Flow

```
Hardware (V4L2 + ALSA)
  → vhs_capture_ffmpeg.sh        (FFV1/PCM raw capture)
    → vhs_denoise.sh → denoise.sh  (audio denoise, video bit-exact copy)
      → QTGMC via vspipe + ffmpeg     (deinterlace to progressive; all content including animation)
        → Kdenlive editing
          → vhs_viewer_encode.sh       (H.264/AAC for Plex)
          → vhs_upscale.sh             (AI upscale via Real-ESRGAN)
          → vhs_upscale_anime.sh       (AI upscale, anime model)
```

### Script Delegation Chain

`vhs_edit_prep_pipeline.sh` is the normal entry point. It calls:
1. `vhs_mode.sh archival` — switches OBS/HandBrake/ffmpeg config to archival slot
2. `vhs_capture_ffmpeg.sh` — captures raw VHS to `captures/archival/`
3. `vhs_denoise.sh` — wrapper that delegates to `denoise.sh` for audio cleanup
4. Inline QTGMC step — uses `vspipe` piping `vhs-env/tools/qtgmc.vpy` into ffmpeg

The B&W variant (`vhs_bw_edit_prep_pipeline.sh`) adds a grayscale step after QTGMC.
The animation variant (`vhs_anime_edit_prep_pipeline.sh`) replaces QTGMC with IVTC — this is **no longer the recommended animation workflow**. Animation now uses the standard QTGMC pipeline (`vhs_process.sh`), with VDecimate run after Kdenlive editing before upscaling.
The OBS variant (`vhs_obs_edit_prep_pipeline.sh`) skips capture and starts from an existing OBS recording (picks newest date-stamped MKV in `~/Videos/` by default).
`vhs_process.sh` is the re-processing entry point — takes an existing archival/denoised MKV, re-runs denoise and/or QTGMC without recapture, and hands off to Kdenlive.

### Standalone Utility Scripts

- `vhs_qtgmc_only.sh` — runs QTGMC on a single file without the full pipeline. Useful for re-running deinterlace with different settings.
- `vhs_ivtc.sh` — runs IVTC on a single denoised file (no capture, no denoise). Converts 30fps telecined → 24fps progressive.
- `vhs_fix_sync.sh` — corrects A/V drift by computing `atempo` from stream duration differences. Copies video, re-encodes audio (AAC). Chains `atempo` filters for extreme drift values outside 0.5–2.0 range.
- `vhs_viewer_probe_all.sh` — batch ffprobe of all files in `captures/viewer/`, produces per-file reports and a TSV index in `captures/viewer/_probe_reports/`.
- `vhs_upscale_bw.sh` — B&W variant of `vhs_upscale.sh`, applies grayscale filter (`hue=s=0`) during frame extraction.

### Key Design Patterns

- **All scripts use `set -euo pipefail`** and expect the same from new scripts.
- **Ctrl+C (exit 130) during capture is treated as a normal stop**, not a failure — the pipeline continues if an output file exists.
- **Environment variables override everything.** Every tunable parameter has an env default. Positional args override env where accepted.
- **Capture files are auto-renamed to `seg###.mkv`** (monotonic, never overwrites) in the archival directory.
- **ffmpeg binary selection:** Scripts prefer `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg` (DeckLink-capable build), falling back to PATH. The `ffmpeg-current` symlink points to the active slot's `ffmpeg/` directory.
- **QTGMC runs via VapourSynth.** The `vhs-env/tools/qtgmc.vpy` script reads config from env vars (`VS_INPUT`, `VS_TFF`, `VS_FPSDIV`, `VS_PRESET`). It pipes Y4M through vspipe into ffmpeg.
- **IVTC runs via VapourSynth.** The `vhs-env/tools/ivtc.vpy` script uses vivtc (VFM + VDecimate) to recover 24fps from telecined 30fps animation. Reads `VS_INPUT` and `VS_TFF`.
- **VapourSynth plugins are explicitly loaded** in `qtgmc.vpy` and `ivtc.vpy` (autoload is unreliable). Plugin paths: `~/.local/share/vsrepo/plugins/` and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/vapoursynth/`.
- **PYTHONPATH must include `~/.local/share/vsrepo/py`** for VapourSynth scripts. All scripts that call vspipe set `PYTHONPATH="$HOME/.local/share/vsrepo/py${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}"`.
- **Auto-idet drives QTGMC decisions.** `vhs_process.sh` and `vhs_obs_edit_prep_pipeline.sh` run ffmpeg's `idet` filter on a sample of frames to detect interlacing. If `TFF+BFF > Progressive`, QTGMC runs automatically. Override with `FORCE_QTGMC=1` or `SKIP_QTGMC=1`.

### Restore Safety

`restore_vhs_env.sh` refuses to run if OBS or HandBrake are currently open (checks via `pgrep`). Before overwriting, it moves the existing config aside as `.PRE-RESTORE.<timestamp>`.

### Environment Slots (`vhs-env/`)

Three configuration slots: `archival`, `viewer`, `game`. Each contains OBS Studio config, HandBrake config, and an `ffmpeg/capture.env` file defining hardware and codec settings. `vhs_mode.sh` switches between them; `backup_vhs_env.sh` and `restore_vhs_env.sh` manage snapshots.

### Capture Hardware

Defined in `vhs-env/archival/ffmpeg/capture.env`:
- Video: USB capture device via V4L2, 720x480 YUYV422 @ 30fps
- Audio: ALSA `hw:CARD=MS210x,DEV=0`, 48kHz stereo
- Color: SMPTE 170M (NTSC), TV range

### Upscale Pipeline (`vhs_upscale.sh`)

Chunked and resumable. Per-segment: extract JPEG frames → Real-ESRGAN 4x → downscale to 2x → H.264 encode. Segments stored as checkpoints in `vhs_upscale_work/<stem>/segments/`. A config fingerprint prevents mixing segments from different settings (override with `ALLOW_MIXED=1`).

The animation variant (`vhs_upscale_anime.sh`) is identical but defaults to the `realesrgan-x4plus-anime` model for drawn/cel content. All three upscale scripts (`vhs_upscale.sh`, `vhs_upscale_bw.sh`, `vhs_upscale_anime.sh`) default to `CRUSH=none` (hqdn3d only, no lutyuv remap, no brightness uplift). `BRIGHTNESS` accepts named levels (`none`=0, `low`=0.02, `medium`=0.05, `high`=0.095) or a raw float.

**Animation upscale pipeline for Kdenlive EDIT_MASTERs:** By the time a file is an EDIT_MASTER, QTGMC has already been run (FORCE_QTGMC=1 is the default in `vhs_process.sh`). The upscale pipeline for animation EDIT_MASTERs is therefore:
1. `vhs_vdecimate.sh` on the EDIT_MASTER → removes telecine duplicates, produces 24fps FFV1
2. `vhs_upscale_anime.sh` on the VDecimate output

## Key Directories

- `captures/archival/` — immutable raw captures (never modify)
- `captures/stabilized/` — denoised/QTGMC intermediates
- `captures/viewer/` — disposable Plex/YouTube derivatives; final YouTube files use the naming convention `VHS [Type] — [Title].mkv` (em dash, not hyphen)
- `vhs-env/{archival,viewer,game}/` — OBS/HandBrake/ffmpeg config slots
- `backups/` — timestamped config backups
- `logs/` — per-run logs for capture, denoise, idet, QTGMC steps

## Dependencies

- ffmpeg (with FFV1 encoder), ffprobe, sox
- VapourSynth: vspipe, havsfunc (QTGMC), vivtc (IVTC), ffms2, mvtools, fmtconv, nnedi3, miscfilters
- Real-ESRGAN: `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan` (Vulkan GPU), models in `~/opt/realesrgan-ncnn/models`
- ROCm upscale: `~/bin/realesrgan-rocm` → `~/opt/realesrgan-rocm/driver.py` (PyTorch+ROCm); use `BATCH_SIZE=2` for x4plus/x4plus-anime on 16 GB VRAM
- OBS Studio, Kdenlive

## Philosophy

- **Capture once** — raw archival masters are ground truth and should never be modified.
- **Process many times** — denoise, QTGMC, and viewer encodes are repeatable from the archival master.
- **Retain masters when storage allows** — the pipeline always produces a lossless master; whether it is kept afterward depends on available storage. When space is constrained, only the viewer copy is retained.
- **Viewer copies are processed for watchability** — deinterlacing, AI upscaling, luma conditioning, and brightness adjustment are applied to the access copy only. These are not part of the archival record.
- **Editing is cuts-only** — no color grading, dropout repair, or image stabilization. VHS artifacts are preserved, not corrected.
- **Viewer files are disposable; masters are the goal.**

## When Modifying Scripts

- Preserve the FFV1+PCM codec policy for any new archival/intermediate outputs.
- Use `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` as the default `FFMPEG_BIN` (except capture scripts which prefer `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`).
- Keep scripts composable — each script should be runnable standalone and as part of a pipeline.
- Audio timestamp rebasing (`aresample=async=..., asetpts=N/SR/TB`) is critical for A/V sync; don't remove it without understanding the drift implications.
- The `vhs_denoise.sh` → `denoise.sh` delegation is intentional: `denoise.sh` handles the actual SoX/ffmpeg work, `vhs_denoise.sh` adds preset logic and default paths.
